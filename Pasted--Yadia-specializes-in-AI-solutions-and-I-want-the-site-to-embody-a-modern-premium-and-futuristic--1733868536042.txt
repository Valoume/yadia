 Yadia specializes in AI solutions, and I want the site to embody a modern, premium, and futuristic feel. The main goals are to:
	1.	Present Yadia’s services, mission, and brand identity.
	2.	Encourage visitors to book an appointment or complete an AI-powered audit form.
	3.	Promote the sale of an e-book related to AI applications and business strategies.

Currently, the site is very basic and lacks the sophisticated design, smooth user journey, and polished interactivity I’m aiming for. I need detailed, actionable, and creative recommendations on how to overhaul and refine the site’s visual design, navigation, layout, typography, imagery, animations, and content hierarchy.

Key points to improve:
	•	Visual Identity & Branding:
	•	Strengthen the premium, futuristic vibe using the brand colors (#153739 dark green and #BDA056 gold).
	•	Suggest fonts, imagery, iconography, and layout styles that enhance trust, professionalism, and innovation.
	•	Navigation & Structure:
	•	Introduce a sticky menu with clear, intuitive navigation.
	•	Guide users effortlessly from the landing page to key CTAs (booking appointments, filling out the audit form, and exploring the e-book).
	•	Refine the About, Services, FAQ, Contact, Blog, and Form pages for clarity and user engagement.
	•	Content Hierarchy & Messaging:
	•	Strengthen the homepage hero section with a bold statement, a compelling CTA, and a captivating visual.
	•	Make it immediately clear why Yadia is unique, why users should trust it, and how they can benefit.
	•	Integrate the e-book offer smoothly, possibly as a highlighted resource or bonus, without overshadowing the main services.
	•	Interactivity & Animations:
	•	Implement hover effects, scroll-triggered animations, and micro-interactions that feel purposeful rather than gimmicky.
	•	Use animations that reinforce the high-tech, AI-driven narrative of the brand.
	•	Responsiveness & Performance:
	•	Ensure all improvements are mobile-friendly, load quickly, and provide a seamless experience across devices.
	•	Suggest ways to optimize images, icons, and other assets for better site speed and user satisfaction.
	•	Conversion & Engagement:
	•	Recommend placement and styling of appointment booking CTAs and the audit form prompt to maximize conversions.
	•	Suggest ways to highlight the e-book as an added value, encouraging downloads or purchases.
	•	SEO & Content Strategy:
	•	Offer insights on how to structure page content and metadata for better search visibility.
	•	Suggest blog topics, content layouts, or on-page SEO techniques that align with Yadia’s AI expertise.

What I want from you (the AI):
Provide a step-by-step, expert-level strategy to transform the current basic site into a sleek, high-conversion digital platform that reflects Yadia’s identity and offerings. Include design guidelines, layout structures, content organization ideas, animation concepts, and any best practices for improving user trust, engagement, and conversions. Feel free to propose design mockup ideas, style guides, or UX patterns that would best suit Yadia’s futuristic theme and business goals.

The final output should leave me with a clear vision and practical guidance on how to turn the current rudimentary site into a polished, professional, and engaging online presence that drives appointments, form completions, and e-book sales.
